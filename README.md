# hello-world
This is my introductory repository on gitHub.
I am data analytics student. I am a passionate of getting insights from data.

Continuing to edit my file to add more information.
Getting to be familiar with the gitHub version control tools, and use it like a pro.

Now I am going to start R programming lessons.
I so exited to start this journey. It is going to be fun.
I can't wait to start.
See you then.
